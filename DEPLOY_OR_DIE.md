# Deploy or Die: A Flox Survival Game

## Overview
Deploy or Die is a survival card game where players navigate through the "Dependency Dungeon" as developers, using Flox environments to overcome challenges, defeat bugs, and ultimately deploy their applications to production.

## Theme
Players are developers venturing into the treacherous Dependency Dungeon, where incompatible packages lurk in the shadows, environment conflicts spawn monsters, and the dreaded "Works on My Machine" dragon guards the final deployment gate.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Environment System
- Each player maintains an **Active Environment** (their current build)
- Environments can be **Activated** or **Deactivated**
- Multiple environments can be **Layered** for combo effects
- Environments persist between rooms unless corrupted

### 2. Package Management
- Players collect **Package Cards** to install in their environments
- Packages provide abilities, stats, and special effects
- Some packages have dependencies or conflicts with others
- Package version matters - newer isn't always better!

### 3. Command Actions
Players use **Command Cards** representing Flox subcommands:
- **flox init**: Start a new environment (reset your build)
- **flox search**: Draw 3 Package Cards, keep 1
- **flox install**: Add a Package to your environment
- **flox activate**: Switch between environments
- **flox push/pull**: Trade cards with other players
- **flox list**: Peek at opponent's installed packages
- **exit**: Emergency escape from a bad situation

### 4. Dungeon Progression
- The dungeon consists of **Room Cards** arranged in levels
- Each room presents a **Challenge** that must be overcome
- Challenges require specific packages, commands, or combos
- Defeating a room grants rewards (packages, commands, or artifacts)

## Victory Conditions
- **Solo/Co-op**: Successfully deploy your application by defeating the final boss
- **Competitive**: First player to successfully deploy wins
- **Survival Mode**: Last developer standing as corruption spreads

## Card Types

### 1. Environment Cards
- **Development Environment**: +2 to all package effects
- **Production Environment**: Immune to version conflicts
- **Testing Environment**: Can preview room challenges
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated actions each turn

### 2. Package Cards
Examples:
- **Python 3.11**: Basic attack package, +3 Debug power
- **Node.js**: Fast attacks, can chain multiple actions
- **Rust Compiler**: Heavy damage, slow but reliable
- **Git**: Can revert to previous state
- **Docker**: Create isolated sub-environments

### 3. Command Cards
Action cards based on Flox subcommands with game effects

### 4. Challenge Cards (Rooms)
- **Version Conflict**: Requires specific package versions
- **Missing Dependencies**: Must have prerequisite packages
- **Platform Lock**: Only certain environments can enter
- **Memory Leak**: Drains resources over time
- **Race Condition**: Speed-based challenge

### 5. Bug Monster Cards
Enemies that spawn based on environment problems:
- **Null Pointer Exception**: Attacks randomly
- **Stack Overflow**: Grows stronger each turn
- **Segmentation Fault**: Instant kills if not blocked
- **404 Error**: Hides required resources

### 6. Artifact Cards
Special items found in the dungeon:
- **FloxHub Token**: Share environments instantly
- **Nix Crystal**: Universal package compatibility
- **SSL Certificate**: Pass through security challenges
- **Root Access**: Override any restriction once

## Dungeon Mechanics

### Room Structure
Each dungeon level contains:
1. **Entry Gate**: May require specific environment
2. **Challenge Room**: Main obstacle to overcome
3. **Treasure Cache**: Optional risk/reward side room
4. **Rest Area**: Chance to reorganize environment
5. **Boss Chamber**: Level guardian with unique mechanics

### Corruption System
- Failed challenges add **Corruption Tokens** to your environment
- Too much corruption forces environment deletion ("nuke from orbit")
- Some abilities can cleanse corruption
- Corruption spreads between connected players

### Layering Mechanic
- Combine up to 3 environments for powerful effects
- Each layer adds complexity and potential conflicts
- Master layering for end-game challenges

## Player Progression

### Developer Classes
1. **Backend Dev**: Strong package management, slow movement
2. **Frontend Dev**: Fast and flexible, weaker packages
3. **DevOps Engineer**: Environment manipulation specialist
4. **Full-Stack Dev**: Balanced, can use any package type

### Skill Trees
- **Package Mastery**: Improve package effectiveness
- **Environment Control**: Better layering and switching
- **Command Efficiency**: Reduce action costs
- **Debug Prowess**: Combat bonuses against bugs

## Multiplayer Modes

### Cooperative (2-4 players)
- Share environments via **flox push/pull**
- Combine forces against bosses
- Trade packages to solve puzzles
- Revive fallen teammates with fresh environments

### Competitive (2-4 players)
- Race through parallel dungeons
- Sabotage opponents with bug spawns
- Steal packages with **flox pull** attacks
- First to deploy wins

### Team vs Team (4-8 players)
- Two development teams compete
- Share resources within teams
- Corporate espionage mechanics
- Larger, more complex dungeons

## Advanced Rules

### Version Control
- Keep a **Git History** of your last 3 environment states
- Can revert when things go wrong
- Cherry-pick successful configurations

### Platform Challenges
- Some rooms require specific OS environments
- Cross-platform packages are more valuable
- Platform-switching has a cost

### Time Pressure
- Optional timer mode for speed runs
- Certain challenges have turn limits
- Rush decisions lead to technical debt

## Example Gameplay Scenario

**Turn 1**: Alice draws her starting hand: Python 3.11, flox init, flox search
- Plays **flox init** to create her Development Environment
- Plays **flox install** to add Python 3.11

**Turn 2**: Enters first room - "Dependency Hell"
- Challenge requires 2 compatible packages
- Uses **flox search** to find Node.js
- Installs Node.js, but triggers version conflict!

**Turn 3**: Version conflict spawns a **Bug Monster**
- Must defeat bug or take corruption
- Python 3.11 provides +3 Debug attack
- Successfully defeats bug, gains Flask package as reward

**Turn 4**: Advances to next room...
